# Agile Sprint Report Template (Extended)

**Week #:** 9 
**Name:** Isaiah Martinez   
**Repository Link:** https://github.com/IsaiahMartinez42900/Culmination-NinjaReport  
 

## 1. Retrospective (reflecting on last week)
- What went well? I gave shuriken to my enemies to throw after detecting the player 
- What didn’t go well? The enemy is caught throwing shuriken based on the direction it's moving to and not to the character's direction and the enemies aren't facing the direction they are moving in.
- What can I improve next week? I'm going to fix these bugs 


## 2. Current State (Context)
Summarize where the project stands right now (2–3 bullet points).
-Enemy has movement  
-Enemy detects player
-Enemy has shuriken

## 3. User Story (Next Sprint Focus)
Write one or two clear User Stories that define the goal of your next sprint.

**Format:**  
*As an [enemy], I want to [face the direction I'm moving in instead of instead of always left and throw the shuriken when facing the character's direction] so that [it looks like the enemies are actually engaging with the player].*

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
Define 1–3 testable conditions that prove your User Story is satisfied.

**Format:**  
*Given* [the player becomes targeted],  
*When* [the enemies faces the direction of its own direction],  
*Then* [throws shuriken projectiles when its facing the character's direction].

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)
Describe what it means for this sprint’s User Story to be considered complete.

**Format:**  
*The work is considered done when [the enemy ninjas faces the direction of its movement and throw shurikens to the player when they face his direction after detecting him].*

## 6. Blockers (as Help Requests)
Identify problems slowing or stopping your progress, framed as help requests.
- Blocker: Getting stuck on flipping faced directions on the enemies. 
- Help Request: Ask Hosni for tips
  
## 7. Goals (Steps Toward the DoD)
List the specific outcomes you aim to complete this week that will move you toward fulfilling your Definition of Done. These can be partial achievements or incremental tasks.
-Have enemies face the direction where they're moving to
-Have enemies throw shuriken throw when they are facing the player's direction

## 8. Next Steps
List the concrete, actionable tasks you will complete before the next class/report.
-Manipulate flipping the enemies facing direction during the movement
-Code it to throw shurikens when it detects player and facing the player's direction
