# Agile Sprint Report Template (Extended)

**Week #:** 8   
**Name:** Isaiah Martinez   
**Repository Link:** https://github.com/IsaiahMartinez42900/Culmination-NinjaReport  
 

## 1. Retrospective (reflecting on last week)
- What went well? I added stops to the enemy movement and added detection for when the player gets close 
- What didn’t go well? 
- What can I improve next week? I'm going to give shurikens to the enemy ninjas so they throw it when they detect the player


## 2. Current State (Context)
Summarize where the project stands right now (2–3 bullet points).
-Enemy has movement  
-Enemy detects player

## 3. User Story (Next Sprint Focus)
Write one or two clear User Stories that define the goal of your next sprint.

**Format:**  
*As a [player], I want [to be detected] so that [the enemies could shoot shuriken at me].*

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
Define 1–3 testable conditions that prove your User Story is satisfied.

**Format:**  
*Given* [the enemies detect the player],  
*When* [the player is within distance],  
*Then* [shuriken projectiles are thrown].

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)
Describe what it means for this sprint’s User Story to be considered complete.

**Format:**  
*The work is considered done when [the enemy ninjas throw shurikens to the player when they detect him].*

## 6. Blockers (as Help Requests)
Identify problems slowing or stopping your progress, framed as help requests.
- Blocker: Getting an error when using the same shuriken script
- Help Request: Ask Hosni for tips
  
## 7. Goals (Steps Toward the DoD)
List the specific outcomes you aim to complete this week that will move you toward fulfilling your Definition of Done. These can be partial achievements or incremental tasks.
-Add shuriken to my enemies

## 8. Next Steps
List the concrete, actionable tasks you will complete before the next class/report.
-Make another shuriken script specifically for the enemies behavior after detection
