# Agile Sprint Report Template (Extended)

**Week #:** 5    
**Name:** Isaiah Martinez   
**Repository Link:** https://github.com/IsaiahMartinez42900/Culmination-NinjaReport  
 

## 1. Retrospective (reflecting on last week)
- What went well? I fixed my everything I had to do with the shuriken. The cooldown, the limit, and the rotation and the movement.  
- What didn’t go well? The shuriken throw animation that I added, doesn't sync up with the thrown shurikens 
- What can I improve next week? I'm going to leave that minor bug for when I come back to fix all my animations but for next week I'm working on having the camera follow my ninja character.


## 2. Current State (Context)
Summarize where the project stands right now (2–3 bullet points).
-I added shuriken rotation 
-I added my shuriken animation 
-I added my cooldown and limits for my shuriken

## 3. User Story (Next Sprint Focus)
Write one or two clear User Stories that define the goal of your next sprint.


**Format:**  
*As a [player], I want [the shuriken to work] so that [it can used on enemies].*

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
Define 1–3 testable conditions that prove your User Story is satisfied.

**Format:**  
*Given* [the player presses the spacebar],  
*When* [he throws shuriken projectiles],  
*Then* [it will destroy the enemy].

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)
Describe what it means for this sprint’s User Story to be considered complete.

**Format:**  
*The work is considered done when [the cloned shuriken is being moved left or right].*

## 6. Blockers (as Help Requests)
Identify problems slowing or stopping your progress, framed as help requests.
- Blocker: The console in Unity is telling me that the shuriken is being cloned but it's not moving like I had it done before  
- Help Request: Ask Hosni why the shuriken is being prevented from moving
  
## 7. Goals (Steps Toward the DoD)
List the specific outcomes you aim to complete this week that will move you toward fulfilling your Definition of Done. These can be partial achievements or incremental tasks.
-When I throw the cloned shuriken by pressing space, it should move to the right/left and not stay still  
## 8. Next Steps
List the concrete, actionable tasks you will complete before the next class/report.
-Fix the shuriken so that's not staying still and is actually being thrown
-If I have time I'll add a limit to how much can be thrown at once and time it takes for the next shuriken that can be thrown
