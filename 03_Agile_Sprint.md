# Agile Sprint Report Template (Extended)

**Week #:** 5    
**Name:** Isaiah Martinez   
**Repository Link:** https://github.com/IsaiahMartinez42900/Culmination-NinjaReport  
 

## 1. Retrospective (reflecting on last week)
- What went well? I instantiated the shuriken for my ninja character  
- What didn’t go well? In doing so, the shuriken doesn't move  
- What can I improve next week? I'm going to fix my shuriken so that it's moving   


## 2. Current State (Context)
Summarize where the project stands right now (2–3 bullet points).
-I have my sprites
-I have my animations for my character
-I have my shuriken instantiated but just need to fix the code so that it moves

## 3. User Story (Next Sprint Focus)
Write one or two clear User Stories that define the goal of your next sprint.

**Format:**  
*As a [player], I want [the shuriken to work] so that [it can used on enemies].*

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
Define 1–3 testable conditions that prove your User Story is satisfied.

**Format:**  
*Given* [the player presses the spacebar],  
*When* [he throws shuriken projectiles],  
*Then* [it will destroy the enemy].

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)
Describe what it means for this sprint’s User Story to be considered complete.

**Format:**  
*The work is considered done when [the cloned shuriken is being moved left or right].*

## 6. Blockers (as Help Requests)
Identify problems slowing or stopping your progress, framed as help requests.
- Blocker: The console in Unity is telling me that the shuriken is being cloned but it's not moving like I had it done before  
- Help Request: Ask Hosni why the shuriken is being prevented from moving
  
## 7. Goals (Steps Toward the DoD)
List the specific outcomes you aim to complete this week that will move you toward fulfilling your Definition of Done. These can be partial achievements or incremental tasks.
-When I throw the cloned shuriken by pressing space, it should move to the right/left and not stay still  
## 8. Next Steps
List the concrete, actionable tasks you will complete before the next class/report.
-Fix the shuriken so that's not staying still and is actually being thrown
-If I have time I'll add a limit to how much can be thrown at once and time it takes for the next shuriken that can be thrown
