## 1. Retrospective (reflecting on last week)
- What went well? I added the UI for main menu, win state, lose state and for my health state
- What didn’t go well? Everything went well
- What can I improve next week? I'm working on improving the transitions for all my animations so it doesnt look choppy and delayed. 


## 2. Current State (Context)

-Game has player and enemies
-Theres a win and lose state
-Has UI 

## 3. User Story (Next Sprint Focus)
Write one or two clear User Stories that define the goal of your next sprint.

**Format:**  
*As an [user], I want to [improve the ninja animations] so that [it's not delayed when triggered].*

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
Define 1–3 testable conditions that prove your User Story is satisfied.

**Format:**  
*Given* [their animations are fixed],  
*When* [their they complete an action],  
*Then* [animations happen smoother without delay].

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)
