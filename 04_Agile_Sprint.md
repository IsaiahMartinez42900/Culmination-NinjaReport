# Agile Sprint Report Template (Extended)

**Week #:** 5    
**Name:** Isaiah Martinez   
**Repository Link:** https://github.com/IsaiahMartinez42900/Culmination-NinjaReport  
 

## 1. Retrospective (reflecting on last week)
- What went well? I fixed my everything I had to do with the shuriken. The cooldown, the limit, and the rotation and the movement.  
- What didn’t go well? The shuriken throw animation that I added, doesn't sync up with the thrown shurikens 
- What can I improve next week? I'm going to leave that minor bug for when I come back to fix all my animations but for next week I'm working on having the camera follow my ninja character. After that I'm making some presentation slides.


## 2. Current State (Context)
Summarize where the project stands right now (2–3 bullet points).
-I added shuriken rotation 
-I added my shuriken animation 
-I added my cooldown and limits for my shuriken

## 3. User Story (Next Sprint Focus)
Write one or two clear User Stories that define the goal of your next sprint.

**Format:**  
*As a [player], I want [the camera to follow my character on the scene] so that [it can give a proper perspective when engaging in game].*

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
Define 1–3 testable conditions that prove your User Story is satisfied.

**Format:**  
*Given* [the camera follows the player],  
*When* [he moves by pressing "A" or "D"],  
*Then* [the character moves without him disapearing on the scene because the camera view wasn't keeping track].

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)
Describe what it means for this sprint’s User Story to be considered complete.

**Format:**  
*The work is considered done when [camera view follows the ninja character on the x-axis].*

## 6. Blockers (as Help Requests)
Identify problems slowing or stopping your progress, framed as help requests.
- Blocker: Was working before but it followed the character jumping which I didn't want.
- Help Request: Ask Hosni for another way to do it instead of making camera object a child object
  
## 7. Goals (Steps Toward the DoD)
List the specific outcomes you aim to complete this week that will move you toward fulfilling your Definition of Done. These can be partial achievements or incremental tasks.
-Have the camera follow my character through the x-axis and not the y and z-axis.  
## 8. Next Steps
List the concrete, actionable tasks you will complete before the next class/report.
-Code to have camera object follow my character's position on the unity scene
