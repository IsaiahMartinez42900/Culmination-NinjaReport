Where We Stand: Describe your project’s current state. What do you have in hand? (prototype, documentation, assets, ideas, etc.)
I have a ninja throwing 1 shuriken to possible enemies. I did have time to think about what assets to use in the summer. I included some of them. The environment, possible enemies, the ninja and its animations to go with it.
 
What to Keep: Name one thing from your current project that is strong and you plan to carry forward.
My concept of this game is strong. The ninja throwing projectiles to defeat its enemies. 

What to Change: Name one thing you want to alter, fix, or improve this semester.
I do plan on changing some of the things I said I was going to do. One of those things lies within the assets.
I never made it from scratch like I said I was going to do. Also the jump and double jump will be in 1 animation.

Challenges and Problems: What areas of your project are currently causing you concern?
Overall the whole project will be challenging considering there's a quota in place.

What’s Next: Identify the first concrete step you’ll take to move your project forward this term.
Since I'm currently taking an asset development course, my next step should focus on coding the basic functionality of the game first and later focusing on the aesthetics when I have time.
And since I already bought assets, if I have time left I can use what I learned in that class to build assets of my own and apply it to my own project.
