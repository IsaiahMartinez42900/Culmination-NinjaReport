# Agile Sprint Report Template (Extended)

**Week #:** 7   
**Name:** Isaiah Martinez   
**Repository Link:** https://github.com/IsaiahMartinez42900/Culmination-NinjaReport  
 

## 1. Retrospective (reflecting on last week)
- What went well? I added movement on the enemy ninjas 
- What didn’t go well? I also wanted to make the movement more fluid by adding a stop delay on the movement but struggled
- What can I improve next week? I'm going to improve on the movement and maybe start working on enemy detecting the player


## 2. Current State (Context)
Summarize where the project stands right now (2–3 bullet points).
-Player has behaviorial features  
-Enemy has movement

## 3. User Story (Next Sprint Focus)
Write one or two clear User Stories that define the goal of your next sprint.

**Format:**  
*As a [player], I want [the enemy ninjas to move more fluently] so that [the enemies aren't stationary and more engaging].*

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
Define 1–3 testable conditions that prove your User Story is satisfied.

**Format:**  
*Given* [the enemy ninjas move very fluidly with added stops on movement],  
*When* [they are by themselves],  
*Then* [there's improved enemy behavior].

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)
Describe what it means for this sprint’s User Story to be considered complete.

**Format:**  
*The work is considered done when [the enemy ninjas moves to one direction and stops before moving to another direction].*

## 6. Blockers (as Help Requests)
Identify problems slowing or stopping your progress, framed as help requests.
- Blocker: No blockers. I'm almost done with this step.
- Help Request: Recieved help from Hosni even though I was close to figuring it out.
  
## 7. Goals (Steps Toward the DoD)
List the specific outcomes you aim to complete this week that will move you toward fulfilling your Definition of Done. These can be partial achievements or incremental tasks.
-To have the enemy ninjas to stop every time it moves to one direction  
## 8. Next Steps
List the concrete, actionable tasks you will complete before the next class/report.
-Plug in code to have enemies cooldown from walking
