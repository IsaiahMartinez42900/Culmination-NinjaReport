## 1. Retrospective (reflecting on last week)
- What went well? I fixed the enemies direction facing and the shuriken thrown by the enemies when they face the player 
- What didn’t go well? Everything went well
- What can I improve next week? I'm going to add sound to my game 


## 2. Current State (Context)
Summarize where the project stands right now (2–3 bullet points).
-Enemy has movement  
-Enemy detects player
-Enemy has shuriken

## 3. User Story (Next Sprint Focus)
Write one or two clear User Stories that define the goal of your next sprint.

**Format:**  
*As an [user], I want to [add sound to my game] so that [the game doesn't seem so generic].*

## 4. Acceptance Criteria (Given–When–Then)
Define 1–3 testable conditions that prove your User Story is satisfied.

**Format:**  
*Given* [I add sounds to my game],  
*When* [Player and enemies do actions],  
*Then* [my game doesn't feel soo empty and is more like a game].

## 5. Definition of Done (DoD)
Describe what it means for this sprint’s User Story to be considered complete.

**Format:**  
*The work is considered done when [I add sound to player and enemy actions and to my overall game].*

## 6. Blockers (as Help Requests)
Identify problems slowing or stopping your progress, framed as help requests.
- Blocker: No blockers, probably looking for cool sounds that match with my game's style. 
- Help Request: Look at tutorials or go through my previous works
  
## 7. Goals (Steps Toward the DoD)
List the specific outcomes you aim to complete this week that will move you toward fulfilling your Definition of Done. These can be partial achievements or incremental tasks.
-Add sound to player actions

## 8. Next Steps
