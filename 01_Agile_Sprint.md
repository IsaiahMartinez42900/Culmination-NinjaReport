### Notes for Journalling
- Each Sprint Log should be followed by **linked documentation**: research notes, diagrams, code, test logs, slides, etc.  
- Use relative links inside the log to reference supporting files, e.g. `[Diagram v1](./docs-02/diagram-v1.png)`.  
- Always include **citations** for research sources (Zotero citekeys, DOIs, URLs).  
- Record **discarded experiments and ideas** with a note on why they were abandoned.
